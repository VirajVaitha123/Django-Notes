Next we will look at creating a custom user model instead of the built in user model. It will be challenging to follow this section, for now I advise follow along and overtime this section will make your sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom user model is very difficult to switch to after the first migrate command. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of why you might want the custom user model is that Django uses a username to uniquely identify a user during authentication. If you'd rather use an email address, you'll need to create a custom User model by either.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point you are likely to want to change the user model, therefore it's important to start with a custom user model from the start.\n",

    "- Create a Custom User model\n",
    "- Update settings.py\n",
    "- Customize UserCreationForm and UserChangeForm\n",
    "- Add the custom user model to admin.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a Custom User Model\n",
    "A website is a collection of multiple \"apps\" to create one app. This custom user model can be created as a seperate app. Therefore the first step is to create a new directory with all the required files an app would need. Thankfully, django can create this for us without us reinventing the wheel.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Update settings.py <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have created a new app, django must acknowledge this. Enter your_project/settings.py and add the following information to installed_apps. Since we are using a new custom user model, we must tell django this too. There isn't a default value already there as the default doesn't need to be written. However, we can add AUTH_USER_MODEL = \"\" and django will know to use the new user model.\n",
    "```\n",
    "INSTALLED_APPS = [\n",
    "    'django.contrib.admin',\n",

    "```\n",
    "Next we need to makemigrations and migrate. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database schema. makemigrations is responsible for packaging up your model changes into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and migrate is responsible for applying those to your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The migration files for each app live in a “migrations” directory inside of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part of, its codebase. You should be making them once on your development machine and then running the same migrations on your colleagues’ machines, your staging machines, and eventually your production machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "makemigrations basically generates the SQL commands for preinstalled apps (which can be viewed in installed apps in settings.py) and your newly created apps' model which you add in installed apps.It does not execute those commands in your database file. So tables don't created after makemigrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "After applying makemigrations you can see those SQL commands with sqlmigrate which shows all the SQL commands which has been generated by makemigrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "migrate executes those SQL commands in database file. So after executing migrate all the tables of your installed apps are created in your database file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Migrate synchronizes the database state with the current set of models and migrations. Migrations, their relationship with apps and more are covered in depth in the migrations documentation.\n",
    "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/migrations/\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, INSTALLED_APPS contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "django.contrib.admin – The admin site. You’ll use it shortly. <br>\n",
    "django.contrib.auth – An authentication system. <br>\n",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes – A framework for content types. <br>\n",
    "django.contrib.sessions – A session framework.<br>\n",
    "django.contrib.messages – A messaging framework. <br>\n",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles – A framework for managing static files.<br>\n",
    "These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. In addition we have the new custom user model. \n",
    "To do that, run the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations users  \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Custom User Forms\n",
    "In our users app we need to create a forms.py. Since a user model can also be created and edited within django admin we will need to update those built in forms too to point to custom user instead of user.\n",
